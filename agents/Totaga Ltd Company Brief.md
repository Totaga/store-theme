   - Having control over the supply chain will also enable us to ensure faster delivery times and better service quality, enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

### Long-Term Vision: Exclusive Partnerships and Product Development
In the longer term, Totaga aims to not only strengthen partnerships but also to collaborate on exclusive product lines tailored to our customers' needs.

- **Exclusive Products**: 
   - We will explore opportunities to develop exclusive products in collaboration with tech manufacturers, which could include special editions or customizations that enhance privacy and local control features.
